# Frog-Chase
I created this Frog Chase App as a present from my nephew.  He is a big fan of Grogu from the mandalorian and a huge lover of starwars in general.  I incorporated a hodge podge of his other favorite things in the border of the game when I presented it to him.  It was a huge success and put a big smile on his face.

The code itself uses an HTML Canvas to display a 2d background.  The player token is an object containing the image of Grogu from the Mandalorian as well as
the players x and y position and speed.  The objective of the game is to collect frogs before they can run away.

desired feature list:

enemies that can damage grogu if he touches them my thought is create a copy of the frog with a stormtrooper skin that lowers grogu's speed instead.
updating levels at certain point levels that reset speed and increase difficulty
more solidified game objective.
