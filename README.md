# Frog-Chase
I created this Frog Chase App as a present from my nephew.  He is a big fan of Grogu from the mandalorian and a huge lover of starwars in general.  I incorporated
a hodge podge of his other favorite things in the border of the game when I presented it to him.  It was a huge success and put a big smile on his face.
It was coded using almost all Javascript and was modified from a version of snake I made in college.
